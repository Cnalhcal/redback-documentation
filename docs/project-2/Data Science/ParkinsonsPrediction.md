# Parkinson's Disease Prediction Model

This feature has been undertaken to predict the presence of Parkinson's Disease based on the features expressed by patients that can be extracted from the patient's vocal patterns. Parkinson's Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that has the common symptoms of[^1]:
- Tremors, 
- Bradykinesia (Slowed movemend)
- Stiff or rigid muscles
- Impaired posture, balance
- Impaired automatic movements
- Speech changes
- Dexterity degeneration, particularly noticeable in hand writing 

At present, the cause of Parkinson's is utterly unknown but more data collected about patients as well as early intervention and care may aid to slow the onset.
